How to Use the database

There are 2 different main ways to change user data
1. Using User Class:
    So at the start of your game, you will be given a username in the intent.
    Create a UserDatabaseHelper object (lets call it db) and then use User user = db.getUser(username) to get a User object
    Any and all changes during the game should be made to the User object user not the database
    So if you kill a monster and want to add a monster killed then call user.addMonstersKilled(...) not the database update method
    This is because the User class is responsible for the short term updating.

2. Using Database Class:
    After you have finished a checkpoint in the game or something and you want to save the game, then use the UserDatabaseHelper object db
    Use db.updateUser(user) to save it.
