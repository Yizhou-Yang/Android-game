Explanation
1. There are two different database types here.
    The long term storage ( for user resources, monsters killed etc) - done with SQLite
    The short term storage (for most recently logged in user and passwords) - SharedPreferences
    Passwords have been kept in SharedPreferences to protect from SQL Injection and other issues with SQL databases being saved locally on the phone
2. The User Class has been created to provide an easily interpretable object to change data of a user and commit changes
   This also means that if I want to change the SQLite Database to a ROOM database later, it can be done with no changes needed for any code outside the DatabaseSystem
------------------------------------------
Status at Creation-
UserDatabaseHelper - SQL Database for long term data
    This will include last level data
LoginDatabaseHelper - SharedPreferences for short term data
    Created this so that if I want to change the way the login data management works I don't need to touch the LoginSystem

1. Consider Using a User Class that can only be instantiated using a Cursor and then instead of relying on an ArrayList, pass the User around
