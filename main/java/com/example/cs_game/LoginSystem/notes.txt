Explanation of structure
1. This stores the front end for the login system.
2. FrontEndUtility is separated so that neither of the activities have to implement to many functions like string checking
3. Otherwise the Activities are separated by the SOLID principles so that none has to do more than one thing
4. Testing activity is just for my own testing and I have not deleted it as it will be useful in phase 2
5. Note how there are no assumptions in any activity on how the user is implemented or how they are stored in the database
    This means that we can make changes to the database structure in any way and as long as we keep the public API the same there will be no issue.

Expansion Ideas
1. Better XML Layouts / Possibly a graphic background with animated buttons
2. Consider completely discarding SharePreferences for UserDatabaseHelper even with password.
3. Alternately consider encrypting password with hash encoding
