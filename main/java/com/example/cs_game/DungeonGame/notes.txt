Explanation

The dungeon game is a game where you navigate through a screen, collecting resources, and dodging enemies.
If you get killed by an enemy (a bat in the dungeon), your resources are reset to zero and the level ends.
To make the game more challenging, new bats spawn in random locations every few turns.

Customisations you can make to this level are -
- You can choose the size of the screen, which changes the number of resources and the number of bats at
the beginning of the level.
- You can choose the difficulty of the level, which changes the number of turns in which new bats spawn
- You can choose what resource you collect - pizzas or donut

As for the design, class DungeonGameView is the class that creates the UI and draws everything to be displayed
on the canvas. DungeonGameActivity is the backend, where all the storage and calculations take place.
DungeonMainThread handles the game thread.
Additionally, DungeonGameHero and DungeonGameEnemy are subclasses of DungeonGameCharacter, keeping the options
of having more characters in the game open.
DungeonResource and DungeonExit are subclasses of DungeonItem, and I would like to have walls in the game
for phase 2, which will also be DungeonItems.

Earlier quadrant touch controls in dungeongame, now made it touch controls around the knight.
Added system to pick up resources as the knight is moving.
Created the Intermediary Activity with user settings for customization.

------------------------------
To Do
1. Create Intermediary Landing Activity to get user preferences for customization
2.
-------------------------------
Expansion

-------------------------------
Earlier hero death was too specific and hero was not picking up resources efficiently. Fixed that
by specifying a range of quadrants in which resources are picked up or hero dies
-------------------------------
Added the exit door and system for hero to either die or exit. Either event causes game to stop and
new screen showing number of resources collected comes up. If hero dies number of resources is 0.
-------------------------------
Increased resource collection sensitivity and door reaching sensitivity
-------------------------------
Implemented home button behaviour
-------------------------------
Optimised the number of turns a new enemy spawns in to make game playable
-------------------------------
Made menu screens look nicer
------------------------------
Added audio
-----------------------------
Walls function from all directions
